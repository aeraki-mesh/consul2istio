// Controller defines an event controller loop.  Proxy agent registers itself
// with the controller loop and receives notifications on changes to the
// service topology or changes to the configuration artifacts.
//
// The controller guarantees the following consistency requirement: registry
// view in the controller is as AT LEAST as fresh as the moment notification
// arrives, but MAY BE more fresh (e.g. "delete" cancels an "add" event).  For
// example, an event for a service creation will see a service registry without
// the service if the event is immediately followed by the service deletion
// event.
//
// Handlers execute on the single worker queue in the order they are appended.
// Handlers receive the notification event and the associated object.  Note
// that all handlers must be appended before starting the controller.
